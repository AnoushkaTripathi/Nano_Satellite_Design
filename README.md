# Flood mapping using Attention UNet
Flood mapping using Attention U-Net involves employing a specialized neural network architecture called Attention U-Net for the purpose of accurately detecting and mapping flooded areas within images or remote sensing data. The Attention U-Net model integrates the U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms, allowing it to focus on important regions while processing the data. This technique helps enhance the model's ability to distinguish between flooded and non-flooded areas by selectively attending to critical features in the imagery, thereby improving the accuracy of flood mapping and aiding in disaster response and management efforts.
